ðŸ‘‹ Ciao, Iâ€™m @jawidan, an iOS developer with over two years of experience.

What I do is simple. I code, solve Rubik's cubes, and play many video games.
Here, you can find several repositories of mine about mainly iOS development and some Python, Java, Docker related things, which 
I have tried and gained some experience during my Master studies.
